<p> We are planning to make an international transaction system that is community driven. <br>
<br> The process is based on the famous escrow system but in this approach, we are not being the third party
<br> For this project, we will be using the google firebase's cloud service to store data temporarily. Later, we will 
develope our own database for added security of the users.<p>
<p> For the added security of the users, we are planning to have reCAPTCHA for our login page.</p>
