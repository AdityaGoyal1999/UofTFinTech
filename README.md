<p> We are planning to make an international transaction system that is, at core, community driven. <br>
<br> The process is based on the famous escrow system but in this approach, we are not being the third party
<br> For this project, we are using google's reliable firebase authenticaion service to authenticate users. For storing the data, we are using Google's cloud firestore service.<p>
<p>For the data processing to be secure, the project uses Server side scripting instead of client side scripting. We are usign this using a NodeJS script.</p>
